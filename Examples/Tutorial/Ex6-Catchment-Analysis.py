# # Example 6- Catchment analysis from the matrix transpose.
#
# We start with "Swamp Mountain" from the previous notebooks. This is slightly modified so that there are no lakes / pits right at the boundary.
#
# The catchments are identified by first finding all the outflow points of the mesh (local minima that correspond to the boundary mask) and then using the transpose of the downhill-propagation matrix $D^T$ to run information (the unique ID of each outflow points) up to the top of the catchment. 
#
# The stopping condition is that no further change occurs. 
#
# *Note* in the context of multiple pathways, this operation produces a fuzzy catchment. The first thing we do in this notebook is to specify `downhill_neighbours=1`
#
#
# ## Notebook contents

# - [1-2-3 downhill neighbours](#1-2-3-downhill-neighbours)
# - [Upstream propogation](#Set-neighbours-to-1-and-compute-"uphill"-connectivity)

# This time we take care to avoid lakes etc on the boundaries as this makes the catchment analysis more complicated. Visualise the mesh to make sure that this works.

# ## Locating and viewing the outflow points
#
# `quagmire` provides a mechanism to find the outflow points of a domain and return the node values. *Note:* in parallel these are the local node numbers and are not a unique ID. To do this, we can obtain the global ID from PETSc but it does also help to have the indices all be small numbers so we can map colours effectively.

# ## Set neighbours to 1 and compute "uphill" connectivity
#
# In serial, i.e. for this demonstration, we number the outflow points by their order in the local mesh numbering. We can then use the `mesh.uphill_propagation` routine to propagate this information from the outflow to the top of the catchment. 
#
# This routine returns the mesh data (for this processor) of a globally synchronised map of the information propagated from the selected points.
