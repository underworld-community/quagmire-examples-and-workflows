# ## Quagmire.function.geometry
#
# Quagmire mesh variables are numerically differentiable and the various operators defined in the quagmire functions module also support limited (symbolic) differentiation
#
# This is to allow the construction of more complicated operators that are equivalent on the flat plane and the surface of the spehre. 
#
# This functionality is supported through the `quagmire.function.geometry` package.

# ## Naked coordinate systems
#
# Quagmire supports flat 2D meshes and logically 2D meshes on the surface of a sphere. When a mesh is defined, it attaches a geometry to itself which is the starting point for computing
# any differential operators that include mesh variables. It is also possible to access the coordinate system definitions directly to see how the various operators are defined. Let us first
# access a simple, 2D, Cartesian Coordinate Geometry

CartesianCoordinates = fn.geometry.CartesianCoordinates2D()
SphericalCoordinates = fn.geometry.SphericalSurfaceLonLat2D()

# +
# These are the coordinate directions is symbolic form. They are also functions that 
# mask the appropriate member of a coordinate tuple

x = CartesianCoordinates.xi0
y = CartesianCoordinates.xi1

print(x.evaluate(1.0,2.0), y.evaluate(1.0,2.0))

# Another example:

points = np.zeros((20,2))
points[:,0] = np.linspace(0.0,2.0*np.pi,20)

print(x.evaluate(points))

S = fn.math.sin(x)

# These are equivalent

print(S.evaluate(points) - np.sin(points[:,0]))

# ### Vector operators
#
# Partial differential equations are often the balancing of gradients of different quantities. The physical gradients may be very different when expressed in different coordinate systems and therefore we have to be careful to develop coordinate-independent expression for gradients that appear in PDEs. We do this by constructing operators such as div, grad, curl and the Laplacian that are expressed independently of the geometry but understand the underlying coordinate system. 
#
# When we calculate a derivative, they should be symbolically equivalent but the gradients are not.
