## AutoGenerated Notebooks

The **master** scripts for the Quagmire documentation and examples are the (structured) python files located in [the Examples directory](../Examples/README.md).

These notebook files are created and synchronised with the python files by the jupytext plugin for jupyter as a convenience for visualising the notebooks along with their output in the github repository. We anticipate that these files will be deprecated in due course (meaning that they will no longer be version controlled). 

### Motivation for adopting jupytext

Notebook files are not ideal in a revision control environment because 1) the metadata recording the notebook state changes independently of the code and the output that the user sees. The .json format is not designed for automatic merging of files to work well in the git environment and are not particularly easy to repair by hand when conflicts occur. 

Our workflow in parallel usually requires us to work with scripts rather than notebooks. 

Disadvantages are that the output is not preserved in the python files when saved (an advantage for version control) which means that it is not possible to leave output in a file to be viewed by when the notebook is first read or is browsed on github.
