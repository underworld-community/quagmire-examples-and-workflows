    "## Quagmire.function\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Underworld, quagmire provides a function interface that can be used to compose data and operations on the fly in order to construct model equations independent of whatever approach is used for solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Noteably, these are _lazy_ function that are only evaluated when needed. More importantly, when evaluated, they also use the current state of any variables in their definition and so can be placed within timestepping loops where they will always use the information of the current timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of lazy functions available in quagmire:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `MeshVariable` data containers that hold information on the mesh and can return that information at any point by interpolation (or, less reliably by extrapolation) and can also provide the gradient of the data using a cubic spline interpolant (see the documentation for `stripy` for details).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `parameter` is a floating point value that can be used for coefficients in an equation. The value of the parameter can be updated.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `virtual` variables which are operations on `MeshVariables` and `parameters` and contain no data record. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "These lazy functions are members of the `LazyEvaluation` class that defines the following methods / data\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `evaluate(mesh | X, Y)` computes a snapshot of the value(s) at the mesh points of `mesh` or at the points given by X and Y\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `fn_gradient(dir)` is a lazy function that can be evaluated to obtain the gradient in the direction `dir=(0|1)`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `description` is a string describing the result returned by `evaluate`. This is helpful because the function may be a cascade of operations. It very much helps to provide short, useful names for your mesh variables to get back reasonable descriptions. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Note: at present no error checking is done for consistency between the mesh provided to evaluate and the one used to store the original data. This is very bad on our part !"
